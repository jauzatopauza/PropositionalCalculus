Formulas should be entered in infix notation, using only the connectives {not, and, or} and parentheses.
Everything else is treated as a variable. Once the formula has been entered, you can process it
with the following commands.

taut?      -- checks whether the formula is a tautology. If so, prints a proof by resolution.
contr?     -- checks whether the formula is a contradiction. If so, prints a proof by resolution.
nnf        -- prints an equivalent formula in Negation Normal Form.
cnf        -- prints an equivalent formula in Conjunction Normal form.
clauses    -- prints a set of clauses that represents the formula. Helpful when showing a contradiction.
negclauses -- prints a set of clauses that represents the negated formula. Helpful when proving a tautology. 
new        -- signals the program to read a new formula.
help       -- prints the help message.
q          -- quits program.
